# ML-Python

This repository contains a few of the projects I've done using Python for Machine learning and Data science during my leisure time to gain a good undersatnding of the machine learning and data science concepts.

I've published this repository to demonstrate my work and help those who are new to this field like me.

Ive used concepts such as :

1.K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm

2.Deep Learning via Neural Networks

3.Bayes algorithm

4.Logistic Regression

Also I've published a repository named "Machine Learning" which contains a couple of projects done using R software instead of Python.

Thank You

Have a great day.
